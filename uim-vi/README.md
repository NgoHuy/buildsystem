## Description

The package `uim-vi` provides a **clean version** of the package `uim`.

* It focuses on Vietnamese users by providing some basic input modules/methods
  (for example, `telex`, `vni`);
* It doesn't contain a big bunch of all languages supported by `uim`;
* It is customized to make the `uim` friendly to Vietnamese users.

Of course forking isn't a good way. In the future we hope to find a better
way to have our features in the original `uim` source.
