Hello, world.

If you want to start new build instruction (aka new `PKGBUILD`), please
discuss on the developer's list (aka `hackers@lists.theslinux.org`)
and/or create a request on our [ticket system][tsys]. Or you just start
from the `TheSmallBang` branch.

Don't forget to check out and read some guidelines on `TheSmallBang`
and the latest guidelines on `TheBigBang` branch.

If you have any questions, please discuss on our [mailing lists][lists].
