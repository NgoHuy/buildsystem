Hello, world.

If you want to start new build instruction (aka new `PKGBUILD`), please
discuss on the developer's list (aka `theslinux-hackers@theslinux.org`)
and/or create a requeset on our [ticket system][tsys]. Or you just start
from the branch `TheBigBang` or `TheSmallBang`.

Don't forget to check out and read some guide lines on `TheBigBang`.
You also need that branch locally to use our build system (`s-makepkg`).

If you have any questions / suggestions, please discuss on our [mailing lists][lists].
