## Notes

This package provides the command `hostname` that's used by the command
`startx` (from the package `xorg-init`). The package `wicd` also requires
this package to work correctly.

The original ABS package has some utils (`rlogin`, `talk`) that I have
never used so I think those tools should be removed.
